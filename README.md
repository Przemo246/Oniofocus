# Oniofocus
This is a simple web app written in Vanilla JavaScript I created on a front-end bootcamp at **InfoShare Academy**. The design and code is entirely mine (no copy &amp; paste). The concept is taken from an already existing online timer - **[pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/)**.

## Features
* Help yourself focusing on a task (at work or home) and turn on **Oniofocus** timer.
* After the timer stops alarm goes off and the timer switches to the next mode.
* If you're doing something online, you can open another tab and the timer is still visible on the tab.
* Set up your own times in **Settings** or simply go with the default times.

To do:
* Create a progress bar.
* Show timer modes in the title.
